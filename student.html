    <h1>Student Scholarship</h1>
    <p>Student scholarship is an urgent and critical need area at IIT Dholakpur. Tuition fees at IIT Dholakpur for the current academic year are Rs. 2.2 lakhs per year. The total cost of one year of study at IIT Dholakpur, including mess bills, is about Rs. 2.5 lakhs per year (excluding hostel and books). With the increasing diversity of the student population joining IIT Dholakpur, there is now a need to provide financial support to a much larger number of students. Nearly 50% of the students joining the undergraduate program are now from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Considering the huge need for financial assistance, a large number of deserving students are not provided with the support that they deserve. We would like to ensure that no admitted student is denied an IIT Dholakpur education due to lack of funds. Thanks to the generous contributions of alumni in the US, 526 additional named scholarships have been established at IIT Dholakpur so far.</p>

    <h1>Financial Aid Program</h1>
    <p>The Financial Aid Programme (FAP) is an 18-year-old honor-based system of sustainable peer-to-peer support that provides merit- and need-based scholarships to all undergraduate and postgraduate students of IIT Dholakpur (IITD), while also offering career-preparedness initiatives such as industry visits and mentoring. This program aids IIT Dholakpur students—the future leaders of the Institute—in staying enrolled, graduating, and using their education to succeed in their careers and lives.</p>
    <p>Administered by the IIT Dholakpur Alumni Association in collaboration with IIT Dholakpur, Tata Steel Ltd., and the Foundation for Excellence (FFE), FAP offers financial assistance for academic expenses, including tuition, hostel, and mess fees, as well as laptop purchases. Students who experience delays in their scholarships may also apply for assistance. They repay the aid without interest, allowing the funds to support future students in need.</p>
    <p>The program is open to students across all disciplines and degree programs.</p>
     <p>Since its inception in 2007, FAP has supported 2070 IITB students with a disbursal of INR 16.45 crores raised largely from alumni, corporate CSR support from Tata Motors Ltd. and donations received from IITBHF.</p> 
     <p>Today FAP donors are spread across geographies and generations spanning batches between 1967 and 2023</p>
